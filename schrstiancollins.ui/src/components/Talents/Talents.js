            <p>Here is a list of some of the services I provide. If you would
                like to discuss a potential commission, please <a href="mailto:s_chriscollins@hotmail.com">contact
                me</a>.</p>

                <h2>Composer/Arranger</h2>
                <p>If you need original music for an event, film or video game, I can
                compose in any style using both recorded and written mediums. I can
                also arrange songs for differing ensembles, adjust the difficulty,
                transpose, or even simply transcribe music from a recording.</p>
                <p>I have been composing for over 27 years and have studied private
                composition in college with <a href="http://www.uwsp.edu/music/people/faculty/cyoung.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Charles Rochester Young</a> and <a href="http://www.jzaimont.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Judith Lang
                Zaimont</a>. I am skilled in orchestration and digital audio recording
                techniques and have worked with large projects, including a <a href="compositions.php#thumbelina">fully
                orchestrated ballet in 2006</a> for the <a href="http://www.mwt.net/~marilynschoolofdance/MJDT.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Monroe-Jackson Dance Theatre</a>.

                <h2>Pianist/Accompanist</h2>
                <p>I can play for weddings, formal dinners or pretty much any event
                that would go well with piano music in the background. I can
                improvise in many styles including new age, classical or rock,
                providing the appropriate atmosphere without being distracting.</p>
                <p>I have been playing piano since I was four (29 years experience)
                and I have a master's degree in piano performance from the University
                of Minnesota. Whether accompanying, performing or improvising, I can
                guarantee a sound that is professional and appropriate for the
                environment at hand.</p>

                <h2>Music Teacher (piano, drums, composition, digital music production)</h2>
                <p>I currently teach private music lessons near Madison at my home studio in Oregon, WI. More info will be coming soon. Please <a href="mailto:s_chriscollins@hotmail.com">send me an e-mail</a> if you are interested in lessons. I have sixteen years of experience teaching ages five to eighty-five, and I can teach any skill level.</p>
                <h2>Sample Programmer / Sound Developer</h2>
                <p>I started creating virtual instruments as a hobby when I was in high school, and most notably created the <a href="http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php">GeneralUser GS</a> SoundFont bank that has been used as the default instrument bank in a number of software products. This eventually led to my current job with Acoustica designing virtual instruments for <a href="http://www.acoustica.com/mixcraft/"  rel="noreferrer">Mixcraft</a> and <a href="http://www.acoustica.com/pianissimo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pianissimo</a>. I have a strong knowledge of synthesis techniques and can also work in many sampler formats such as SFZ and Kontakt.</p>
