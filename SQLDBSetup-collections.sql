Unfortunately, I was not well-prepared to do an orchestral score, as the quality of my orchestral sounds was not very good at the time.

VALUES('Nocturne', '2012', 'piano_harpsichord', 'A piano piece I wrote for my sister for Christmas 2012. As part of my NAMM demo for Acoustica, I added some strings backing as well. The strings don''t always fit as well as I''d like, but this piece was conceived solely as a solo piano work so it probably works best as such. In the original piano version, the thunder effect is created by rumbling the lowest strings on the piano. At some point I''ll try to get a recording of this on a real grand so I can perform all of the hand-on-string effects that are supposed to be in there. The second half of this song is based on a short improv I did in 1997 called "Dream", which was available on this site previously.')

              was degraded by the judge because the piece was “not in ragtime
